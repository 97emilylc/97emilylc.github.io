### The Data
As an avid film nerd, I was overjoyed when I discovered the the popular website, The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has massive TSV files available [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). I descided to see what I can do with this data and the skills I have picked up at UC Berkeley's Data Science courses. 

Thankfully, there is a third party Python developer that created a rather nice interface to fetch the IMDb data and store them as Movie object, People objects, and similiar structures.
